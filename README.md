# SWT-Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis
Advanced Software Engineering Exercises

## TASK - 1
For the pet project, I have used Python language and the code is relatively small. However, if time permits I would also like to do the same thing using NLP.

Here, I have used Tweepy module to stream live tweets directly from Twitter in real-time. The tweets are visualized and then the TextBlob module is used to do sentiment analysis on the tweets. Based on certain keywords, tweets are refined and then are given a sentiment score of -1(negative sentiment), 0(neutral), 1(positive).


## TASK - 2

#### 1. UML Diagrams (Atleast 3)

Here, I have attached 
+ [Class Diagram](https://github.com/JeelBhalodia/SWT-Sentiment_Analysis/blob/master/UML/class_diagram.PNG)
+ [Activity Diagram](https://github.com/JeelBhalodia/SWT-Sentiment_Analysis/blob/master/UML/Activity%20Diagram.png)
+ [Use-case Diagram](https://github.com/JeelBhalodia/SWT-Sentiment_Analysis/blob/master/UML/Usecase_diagram.png)

I have used lucidchart for the this task.

#### 2. Metrics

I have used both Sonarcube and Codacy for the task.
