# SWT-Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis
Advanced Software Engineering Exercises

## TASK - 1__________________
For the pet project, I have used Python language and the code is relatively small. However, if time permits I would also like to do the same thing using NLP.

Here, I have used Tweepy module to stream live tweets directly from Twitter in real-time. The tweets are visualized and then the TextBlob module is used to do sentiment analysis on the tweets. Based on certain keywords, tweets are refined and then are given a sentiment score of -1(negative sentiment), 0(neutral), 1(positive).
